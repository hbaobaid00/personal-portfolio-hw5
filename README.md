# Welcome to My Personal Portfolio!

This repository is where I build my personal portfolio using skills that I learned from my web development class at UC San Diego. 

In my portfolio, you'll learn who I am, my background and skills, and the experiences that I have under my belt.

If you are viewing my portfolio, and have any questions, feel free to ask me anything using the Contact Page on my site. I look forward to hearing from all of you!
