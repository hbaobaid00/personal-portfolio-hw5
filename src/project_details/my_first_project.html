            <h2 class="page-title">My First Project — VEX Robotics Team</h2>

            <p>
                My first real exposure to engineering, programming, and teamwork came in middle school
                through VEX Robotics. This was the first time I worked on a large technical project—
                designing, building, programming, and competing with an autonomous and driver-controlled robot
                in a regional robotics competition.
            </p>

            <h3>What We Built</h3>

            <p>
                Working as a team, we constructed a robot powered by motors, sensors, and structural components.
                Using VEXcode (a Python-based system), I helped program movement logic, sensor reactions,
                and mechanisms needed to complete competition objectives. Seeing lines of code control real,
                physical systems was eye-opening and sparked my interest in technology.
            </p>

            <h3>Team Collaboration & My Competition Role</h3>

            <p>
                Our group divided responsibilities across mechanical design, building, wiring,
                testing, and programming. While I focused heavily on programming and debugging,
                I also supported assembly and troubleshooting sessions.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was selected as one of our robot drivers — operating the machine during matches,
                reacting to field conditions, and making real-time decisions under pressure.
                This was my first experience applying engineering decisions in a competitive environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although we didn't win the final contest, the experience was invaluable. It taught me
                how iteration, teamwork, and resilience matter more than placement. That lesson stuck
                with me and shaped my approach to future work. During the process, I developed skills in:
            </p>

            <ul class="pretty-list">
                <li>Communicating and coordinating under time constraints</li>
                <li>Debugging unpredictable hardware/software behavior</li>
                <li>Learning strategy and adaptation during match play</li>
                <li>Experiencing both failure and motivation to improve</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What This Project Taught Me</h3>

            <p>
                This experience was one of the biggest catalysts for my interest in computer science.
                It showed me that building something is only half the challenge — testing, failing,
                adjusting, and competing reveal the real learning. VEX Robotics made me curious about
                how code, hardware, and problem solving intersect, motivating me to pursue programming
                courses in high school and eventually choose computer science as a major.
            </p>

            <p>
                Looking back, this project wasn't just about robotics—  
                it was about <strong>discovering a path</strong>.
